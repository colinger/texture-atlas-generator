A cross platform (python) implementation of John W. Ratcliffes' excellent texture-atlas algorithm written in C (http://code.google.com/p/texture-atlas/).

This project takes things further than texture-atlas by creating the atlases and data files from the information generated by the texture-atlas algorithm.
